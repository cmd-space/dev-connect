		<p><strong><em>Persona</em></strong></p>
		<strong>Age:</strong><p>38</p>
		<p>On the organization side of the project, a typical persona is a board member of a well know local non-profit organization.  Typically this person is female and is middle aged to older.  She works part-time for this non-profit as she has other endeavors as well.  As a result she has a very busy schedule.  However, serving on this board, for a cause she believes in, is very near and dear to her heart and is a labor of love.</p>
		<p>Although she is not technically savvy as a web-developer, she has nonetheless embraced technology and has a strong presence on social media.  As a result, she has been tasked with creating an online presence for her organization.  Since she is already burden with a heavy schedule, she is certainly feeling overwhelmed by this task at hand.</p>
