		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Frank Marlin</p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong> 52</p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Owner of the Amigo's Restaurant, a small sandwich and soup kitchen. A busy man without a lot of time on his hands, he does a lot of the work himself with a few family members and some part time employees. He's been losing business due to rising competition from franchises popping up near his location, and decided that he needs an online presence and ordering system to stay competitive. He does not have a lot of money for this, but can pay someone a small sum to build his site. He has thought about using Square Space, but does not have the time to even build a site with that as he works seven days a week.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong>A simple HP desktop computer at his workplace, used to place orders for new food and restaurant supplies. And a Dell notebook laptop for personal use at home. Also has a Samsung Galaxy S4 smart phone he uses primarily for texting and checking emails.</p>
