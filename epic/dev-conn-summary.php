		<h1>DevConnect Executive Summary</h1>
		<p>Dev Connect is a website that connects web developers with non-profit organizations that need an online presence. Dev Connect will allow web developers to search projects posted by non-profits in need of this content. The businesses can also search for web developers and view their portfolios to find preferred design styles.</p>
		<p>This site will be designed to promote a symbiotic relationship between non-profit organizations that have limited funding for a professional website who need volunteer or low cost work, and entry to mid level web developers looking for work experience and a way to improve and showcase their skills.</p>
		<p>Non-profit organizations will be verified by contact information and a manual check of their EIN given to them by the IRS from a system administrator upon sign up. Web developers will not be verified upon sign up, but any abusive or illegitimate use of the site will be moderated and dealt with.</p>
		<h2>Ideas</h2>

			<li>We will have two primary users, developers and organizations. They will be able to use the site to interact with each other and share content and needs.</li>
			<li>There will be a jobs board, where organizations can post projects and link them to their profile where interested developers can contact them.</li>
			<li>Devs will be able to link their work to their profile, so organizations can check it out easily.</li>
			<li>Star rating and review system for organizations to leave feedback on developers.</li>
			<li>Only allow registered users to see contact information for the job listings.</li>
			<li>Mailgun and Login with Github</li>
