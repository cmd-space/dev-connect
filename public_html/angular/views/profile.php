						<p>Hello!
							My name is Devon Beets and I am a web developer from Albuquerque, NM. I have a passion for beautiful
							design and I love to work on a wide variety of projects!
							I especially hold a deep place in my heart for people with physical disabilities, my mother has worked
							with them since I was young and I have aloways looked up to her and her ability to give back to her
							community with her work and would like to do the same! If you would like to request my service, I can
							reached at the following contact information below! :)
