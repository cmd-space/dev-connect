		<h1>Non-Profit Organization Persona</h1>
		<p><strong>Name:</strong> Jill Ann Jackson</p>
		<p><strong>Age:</strong> 48</p>
		<p><strong>Profession:</strong> Jill is the Vice Chairman of the local chapter of the League of World Children Rights Advocacy.  This non-profit organization is involved with promoting children's issues within the inner city. As a board member of this charity, she is involved with important decisions regarding marketing, finances, and fund raising.</p>
		<p><strong>Technology:</strong> Jill is a mainly a PC laptop user.  She is also an iPhone user and has fully integrated most of its features within her busy life.  Although she is not technically savvy as a web-developer, she has nonetheless embraced technology and has a strong presence on social media. As a result, she has been tasked with creating an online presence for her organization. </p>
		<p><strong>Attitudes and Behaviors:</strong> Jill has other personal business endeavors as well. As a result, she has a very busy schedule. However, serving on this board, for a cause she believes in, is very near and dear to her heart and is a labor of love.</p>
		<p><strong>Frustrations and Needs:</strong> Jill is already burden with a heavy schedule.  As a result, she is certainly feeling overwhelmed by this task at hand.  Also, there is a budget shortfall looming this year and she feels personally responsible for that.  Therefore, she does not have the profession website budget.  Therefore, she is looking into low cost alternatives such as a do-it-yourself site such as wix.com.</p>
		<p><strong>Goals:</strong> Jill is a perfectionist.  She already has in her mind what her organization's website should look like and from her personal experience she feels she has handle on what a good user experience should be for her web site.</p>

		<h1>Non-Profit Use Case</h1>
		<p>While researching online for possible alternatives for an ease of use website designer like Wix, Jill is steadily finding that these sites don't have the level of customization that she wants to make it so her website looks just right.</p>
		<p>Upon asking a coworker who has had to contract for web development before, she finds that she may be able to look for some younger volunteers, that have the right skills but need some experience that she could ask to help.</p>
		<p>After some searching, she finds Dev Connect, which upon a read over of the home page seems to be a viable option based on her criteria. She signs up for the site, and after carefully constructing her company's profile page, begins to post her project to the job board.</p>
